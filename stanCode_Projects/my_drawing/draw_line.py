This file shows how to use campy mouse
to draw lines(GLine) on the window where
two points of the line are randomly chosen.
The first click will create a circle shown
on the window whereas the second one won't
and in the meantime the initial circle will
disappear, meaning there is only a line once
the user clicks for the second time.

    This program creates lines on an instance of GWindow class.
    There is a circle indicating the userâ€™s first click. A line appears
    at the condition where the circle disappears as the user clicks
    on the canvas for the second time.
